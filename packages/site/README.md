This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Quick Start

If you haven't already done so, please follow the quick start
section found in the README at the root of this project.

Then to run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev -w site
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the site.

## Site highlights

- There is an API route for automatically generating Open Graph images using [Vercel OG](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation).
  - The template (`./src/app/api/og/route.tsx`) is written as a React component, meaning the media team does not need to generate supporting assets. Additionally if the template or branding is ever changed, all article OG images will automatically be updatedâ€”both for new and historic content.
